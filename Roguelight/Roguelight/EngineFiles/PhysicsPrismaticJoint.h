public:
	//! A prismatic joint (aka slider joint) allows for relative translation of two bodies along a specified axis. A prismatic joint prevents relative rotation.Therefore, a prismatic joint has a single degree of freedom.
	//! To specify a prismatic you need to provide two physics actors. The initialization function assumes that the physics actors are already in the correct position.
	//! Always delete joint before deleting the attached actors
	//! Deleting an actor attached to the joint will allways delete the internal Box2D joint.
	//! @param actAPtr: The first actor that is attached to this joint.
	//! @param anchorA: The local anchor point relative to actA's origin.
	//! @param actBPtr: The second actor that is attached to this joint.
	//! @param anchorB: The local anchor point relative to actB's origin.
	//! @param jointAxis: The axis along which the physics actors will move according to each other. This axis is fixed in the two bodies and follows their motion.
	//! @param collide: if true the actors attached to this joint will collide
	PhysicsPrismaticJoint(PhysicsActor *actAPtr, DOUBLE2 anchorA, PhysicsActor *actBPtr, DOUBLE2 anchorB, DOUBLE2 jointAxis, bool collide = false);

	//! A joint limit forces the joint angle to remain between a lower and upper bound. The limit will apply as	much torque as needed to make this happen. The limit range should include zero, otherwise the joint	will lurch when the simulation begins.
	//! @param enableLimits: enable or disable the translation limits
	//! @param lowerTranslation: if enabled, his specifies the lower translation
	//! @param upperTranslation: if enabled, his specifies the upper translation

	//! A joint motor allows you to specify the joint speed (the time derivative of the angle). The speed can be negative or positive.A motor can have infinite force, but this is usually not desirable
	//! @param enableMotor: enable or disable the motor
	//! @param targetSpeed: if enabled, his specifies the target speed in pixels per second
	//! @param maxMotorForce: if enabled, his specifies the maximum force
